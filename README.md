admin.rbxs (expanded to administration.rbxs) is a utility for ROBLOX meant to help place owners in administrating, maintaining and debugging their games on-line. It is developed by Mark Otaris.

The goal of the project is to create an utility that allows users given access to the utility by a place's owner to use commands to manipulate various aspects of the game in an online server. This means that any user given administrative access by a place's owner may use commands to kill the characters of other players, banish them from the game, manipulate the game's lighting, and do similar things. admin.rbxs is meant to include a permission system which makes it simple for a game owner with some basic scripting knowledge to define accurately which users may perform what actions.
